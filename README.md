# Handwritten-digits-prediction
 
## About the project
This is my first machine learning project because I want to deep down into AI field, and I want to know how computer can "Learn" thing.
I used MNIST Digits dataset for training my model, it includes thousands of screenshots of handwritten digits, without environment light conditions.

## Accuracy and Loss
After 20 training epochs the average validate accuracy is ~99.08% and validate loss is ~5.1%
